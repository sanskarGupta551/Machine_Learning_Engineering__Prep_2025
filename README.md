# MLOps Reference Architecture: From Experimentation to Production

## Architecture Overview

This MLOps reference architecture addresses the critical engineering challenges that determine the success of production machine learning systems. While model development receives significant attention, the infrastructure required to deploy and maintain models in production often defines the actual business value realized from ML investments.

These six carefully designed architectural components form an integrated MLOps ecosystem blueprint that streamlines the journey from experimentation to production deployment. Each component solves specific operational challenges while conceptually working in concert to enable reliable, scalable, and compliant machine learning systems—the foundation of successful enterprise ML adoption.

The architecture demonstrates comprehensive MLOps expertise across the full lifecycle, from feature management through experimentation, deployment, serving, monitoring, and governance—capabilities essential for transforming promising models into sustained business value. By focusing on the architecture rather than specific implementations, this reference design can be adapted to various cloud platforms, on-premises environments, or hybrid approaches.

Cross-cutting concerns such as security, scalability, and interoperability are addressed throughout the architecture, ensuring it meets enterprise requirements while maintaining flexibility for different implementation technologies.

## Reference Architecture Design
